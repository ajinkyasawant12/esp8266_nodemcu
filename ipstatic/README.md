## IPofDevice
Code gives the ip acquired by the device. We are able now to access with a browser to the assigned ip address, discovered above, and interact with a small interface that allows us to activate or not the PIN1 output.

Run the command form ESPlorer command bar
 ```
 print(wifi.sta.getip())
 ```
